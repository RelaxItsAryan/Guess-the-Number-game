# Number Guessing Game (2-Player, 1–100)

A simple Python-based number guessing game for two players. Each player gets a turn to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The player who guesses the number in fewer attempts wins.

# Features

# How the Game Works

The program asks for both players' names.

Player 1 goes first and tries to guess the secret number.

For each guess, the game provides hints such as "Too high" or "Too low".

After Player 1 finishes, Player 2 gets their turn with a new secret number.

The player who needs fewer attempts wins the game.

If both players use the same number of attempts, the game ends in a tie.
